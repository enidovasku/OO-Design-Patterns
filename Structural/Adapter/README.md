# Adapter Pattern

Adapter pattern is placed under the category of structural design pattern. 

## Getting Started

“Adapter” as the name suggests is the object which lets two mutually incompatible interfaces communicate with each other. But why we want “someone” to adapt to something? You will get an answer if you answer this simple thing- Your laptop charger which you bought in US has flattish pins which easily gets hooked into electrical sockets in US. But when you travel to European countries you may have round holes in the electrical sockets. What do you do then?-Simple buy socket adapters/converters for that.
